Easier Recipe is a platform made for recipe storage and sharing!

Cooking should be an accessible and enjoyable experience for all, and so here is some of the current functionality of this website:

-   Allow users to view a catalogue of recipes submitted by other users
-   Allow users to submit their own recipes either by manually filling out a form or pasting the URL to an existing recipe, at which point it will be handled by one of two recipe scraper APIs
-   Users can edit existing recipes after pasting the links, altering certain attributes
-   Recipe ingredients can all be converted to grams with the click of a button

Current features I am working on implementing:

-   Support for more variable units
-   The options to edit and/or delete reecipes after they have been posted

There are many big plans for the future of this project, including:

-   Adding a likes system to indicate recipe popularity
-   Adding a filter/search system to easily find recipes
-   Find ingredient information (calories, nutrition, etc.)

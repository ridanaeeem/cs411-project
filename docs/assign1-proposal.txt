Idea 1: Recipe Unit Converter and Substitute 

Online recipes can be delicious but could be improved when it comes to providing users with additional valuable information or making the process easier. Problems that can overcomplicate cooking include lack of consistency from using volumetric measures, not providing nutritional information that can help users plan how much to eat, and not providing common alternatives to unique ingredients that are easily available. Our app can ease these problems by doing three things. First, collect ingredients from a recipe passed by the user and standardize units by weight for consistency and faster prep. Second, calculate nutritional information from ingredients and send it back to the user to help user achieve caloric needs. Finally, provide a list of common alternatives for ingredients to help with rare ingredients or reduce calories in recipe.

Idea 2: Itinerary/Daily Recommendations 

For people looking for things to do in their cities, we will create a web application in which users can provide their location and a timeframe and they will get an itinerary with recommendations for what they can do at the inputted times. These recommendations can be filtered into different categories (such as food, nature, and sports) and the user will be able to provide feedback about what theyâ€™re looking for. We will use a weather API to suggest appropriate activities (such as indoor vs outdoor) and we will use the Google Maps API to find places and determine distances between them. The user can also save places that they like that will be recommended in the future.
